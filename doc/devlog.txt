      		 instead of a file

       Made the sudoku generator and solver code readable, PEP8 compliant, and more efficient. pushed a temporary solving mechanism while trying to find more efficient recursive sudoku solving algos

      Finished MVP
      You can now generate sudokus from your profile which will create appropriate boards which you can then
      	  attempt to solve, and check your answer when you want to. It's actually very neat.
      Everything is done asynchronously, too
