# Game Overview
The classic logic game, Sudoku, in a portable website built with JavaScript. The puzzles are automatically generated in accordance with difficulty settings: easy, medium, hard, killer. Users can create an account to save finished puzzles and times or can play without an account. A set of weekly leaderboards is displayed on the page, ranking the users by the amount of time it took for them to finish the puzzle, differentiated by the difficulty setting. If the user is stuck, they can request hints, with a certain penalty being added to their time setting.
